Here I'm trying to demonstrate some SOLID OOP design principles 
Written by Serge Klokov in 2019
I started to study it in 1994... actively I started to use OOP in 1998, and I use it till now.
This demo was created, because somebody asked me to explain it on example, 
and I was ... not immediately able to do it. 

Briefly it suppose to help not to write macaroni code
